# string-things

Simple string functions in one tiny bundle.

I found a work project using a 30kb library to kebab case a string which was of course too large, so I have tried to provide this function and more in a small package for your web projects.

## Usage

```
npm install string-things
```

or

```
yard add string-things
```

## Examples

Will update soon..
